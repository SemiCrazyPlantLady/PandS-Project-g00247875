# PandS-Project-g00247875
Programming and scripting Project

To carry out this project here are my plans:

1. Investigate the data, learn what I can from around the web
2. Read the documentation of appropriate libraries for exploring and visualising the data
3. Use a jupyter notebook to create a report with my code and thoughts side by side
4. Start the technical bit
   1. Discuss the data
   2. Load the data using Pandas
   3. Generate some visualisations of the data to understand its shape and size
   4. create a summary of the data and interpret it
   5. generate a histogram and scatterplot of the data and interpret them
   6. some nice extras.
   7. Conclusions of what was learned
